Task:

Write a bash script to monitor the test process in a Linux environment.
The script must meet the following requirements:
1 Run at system startup (it is preferable to write a systemd unit in addition to the script)
2 Run every minute
3 If the process is running, then knock (via https) on
https://test.com/monitoring/test/api
4 If the process has been restarted, write to the log /var/log/monitoring.log
(if the process is not running, then do nothing)
5 If the monitoring server is unavailable, also write to the log.
